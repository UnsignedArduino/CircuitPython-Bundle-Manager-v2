# CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager-v2
> A Python program that makes it easy to manage modules on a CircuitPython 
> device!

The CircuitPython Bundle Manager v2 is a program that allows you to easily 
download bundles and use them to install modules on CircuitPython devices!

As the name implies, it's version 2 of the original 
[CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager)
with many more fixes and features!

## Installation

### Install from source

#### Windows

1. `cd` to somewhere convenient. (Like a drive where all your projects go`)
2. Download the repo
   (`git clone https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager-v2`)
3. `cd` into the downloaded repo. 
4. Create a virtual environment. (`python -m venv .venv`)
5. Activate the virtual environment. (`".venv/Scripts/activate.bat"`)
6. Install the requirements. (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
7. Run! (`python main.py`)

#### Linux / macOS

1. `cd` to somewhere convenient. (Like your home directory)
2. Download the repo
   (`git clone https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager-v2`)
3. `cd` into the downloaded repo. 
4. Create a virtual environment. (`python3 -m venv .venv`)
5. Activate the virtual environment. (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
6. Install the requirements. (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
7. If the installation fails, then follow the instructions to 
   [install `cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/#building-cryptography-on-linux)
   on your machine. Then try step 6 again.
